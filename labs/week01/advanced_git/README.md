# "Advanced" Git

Walk through and execute the following sections of the tutorial at https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/advanced-git-commands/:

* `Git Stash` - Example 1 and Example 2
* `Git Cherry Pick` - Example 1 and Example 2
* `Git Reset`
* `Git Bisect`

**NOTE: Where the tutorial references `notepad`, you can use `touch` instead (in Linux or MacOS). Also, if you find that a provided instruction is not working as described, Google it (or ask and I can help with fixes). Finally, when executing each section, use the display from the tutorial's `git log --online` to see what kinds of actions have been taken (and that you should take as part of executing the tutorial).
