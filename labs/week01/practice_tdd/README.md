# Practice TDD

Build a base employee class that includes the following properties and methods:

* Properties
    - Employee number
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Department
* Methods
    - Print badge (outputs employee info captured above for print on a badge)

Build an hourly employee class which inherits from your employee class and that includes the following properties and methods:

* Properties
    - Hourly rate
* Methods
    - Process pay (hourly rate * 40 hours)

Build a salaried employee class which inherits from your employee class and that includes the following properties and methods:

* Properties
    - Annual salary
* Methods
    - Process pay (annual salary divided by 52)

Ensure you have tests in place to properly validate each. Use Test-Driven Development to build out your tests followed by the code under test.
