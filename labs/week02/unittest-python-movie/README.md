# unittest - Python Movie

Create a Movie class that includes attributes for name, year released, and genre (science fiction, romance, drama, etc.). Prompt the user for inputs for each attribute, create a new instance of the Movie class using user input values, and output a summary using the format of “<movie name> released in <year> is a <genre> film”.

Include unit tests (using the unittest framework) for each property and method defined on the Movie class.
