# unittest - Python Word Count

Using https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt copy the text file contents 
(“Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland”) and save to a text file on your local system. Parse through 
the text, counting the number of times “Alice”, “Mad Hatter”, “Rabbit”, “Caterpillar” and “March 
hare” appear (you can use a dictionary to store the results). Print a summary of the final counts.
Make sure you handle different casing (i.e. “Rabbit” and “rabbit” should both count as 
occurrences of “Rabbit” in the text).

Create a class that processes the word count (accepting an input string) and executes the parse,
word counting, and case handling logic. Write unit tests against the word counting class only,
including all of the cases outlined in the requirements above.

Also, create a runner that reads the text file contents and passes to the word count class for counting.
You will be writing unit tests against the word count class only.
